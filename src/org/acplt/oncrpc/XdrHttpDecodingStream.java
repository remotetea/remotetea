/**
 * The <code>XdrHttpDecodingStream</code> class provides the necessary
 * functionality to {@link XdrDecodingStream} to receive XDR data through
 * HTTP tunnels.
 *
 * <p>Please note that there is currently no standard about how to tunnel
 * XDR data over HTTP connections. There are a (quite a) few solutions out
 * there, but they are more or less incompatible due to the lack of a RFC.
 *
 * <p>This class is responsible solely for <em>receiving</em> ONC/RPC replies.
 * The reply data is base64 encoded and embedded within an ordinary plain
